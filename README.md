This study is part of [Haiyang's PhD thesis (Chapter 5)](https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/50468).

## Abstract
Perceptual categorisation is indispensable to our daily life. Whether categorisation is supported by graded or all-or-none neural mechanisms in high-level visual cortex still remains less clear. In this study, we addressed this issue by looking into the N170, the first large negative event-related potential component over visual cortex evoked by face stimuli. Specifically, we investigated whether the N170 is generated in a graded or an all-or-none manner; that is, is the N170 amplitude graded with the amount or quality of face information available in an image, or is a full response generated whenever a face is perceived? To answer this question, we employed linear mixed-effects modelling with null hypothesis significance testing and equivalence tests to inspect the dependency of the N170 amplitudes on stimulus properties and their associations with participants’ subjective perception. Consistent with previous studies, we showed that a stronger N170 was evoked by faces presented for longer durations regardless of subjective confidence, which seems to support the N170 amplitudes being graded. However, further analysis with equivalence tests revealed that faces presented for different durations evoked a comparable N170 in the same blocks when they were perceived with similar high subjective confidence. Previous evidence supporting the graded hypothesis is more likely to be an artefact of mixing heterogeneous “all” and “none” trial types in signal averaging. These results support the hypothesis that the N170 is generated in an all-or-none manner, which suggests that categorisation of faces may follow a similar pattern.
